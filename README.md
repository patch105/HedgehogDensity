The primary aim of this project is to calculate the density and trapping parameters (g0 and sigma) of the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeaus) in an exotic grassland environment on the Otago Peninsula, Dunedin, New Zealand.

The project aims, methods, results, and discussion are presented in our paper entitled: "Population density of hedgehogs in exotic grassland on the Otago Peninsula, New Zealand" New Zealand Journal of Ecology (In Review). van Heezik Y., Simpson L., Patterson C.R., Wilson D.J., and Seddon P.J.

The data/code presented here include:
- captfile.txt : The capture-recapture data from the trapping grid, including individual animal IDs, the occasion, and the detector the animal was trapped in
- trapfile.txt : The coordinates of traps in the grid
- Hedgehog_density_Otago_Peninsula_code.html : All code used to run the spatially explicit capture-recapture analysis
